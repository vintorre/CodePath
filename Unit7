Persistant Cross Site Scripting: 
In this attack you can set up a vulnerability through the comment box of WP. Using the injected javascript the attacker can have accesss to anything the administrator has access to, as well as changing their passwords. You must set up a wordpress page, I just used the example page provided with a comment box. After you insert the comment "<a title='x onmouseover=alert(unescape(/hello%20world/.source)) style=position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:5000px;height:5000px  AAAAAAAAAAAA...[64 kb]..AAA'></a>" and the comment is viewed you have access to the administrator account.
